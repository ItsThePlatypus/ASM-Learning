*** LOADING A PROGRAM ***
- To load a program 
    -> gdb <executable name>
- This loads the executable into GDB ready for analysis

*** GDB BASICS ****
- To view a program
    -> list
- To run a program
    -> run
- To quit
    -> quit

*** GENERAL ANALYSIS ***
- Set flavour
    -> set disassembly-flavor <flavour>
- Disassemble a function
    -> disassemble <function/section name>
- Examine a string from address 
    -> x/s <memory address>
    -> E.g: x/s 0x601030
- If you know the name of a variable, you can use
    -> x/s &<variable name>
    -> E.g: x/s &msg

*** DEBUGGING ***
- Set breakpoint
    -> break <function/section>
    -> E.g: break main
- Enable/Disable breakpoints
    -> enable breakpoint <breakpoint number>
    -> disable breakpoint <breakpoint number>
- Delete a breakpoint
    -> delete breakpoint <breakpoint number>

- View registers at breakpoint
    -> info registers
    -> i r 
- Step through program
    -> step 
- Run program to next breakpoint
    -> continue
- Print certain values
    -> print 
    -> p 

*** USEFUL COMMANDS ***
- Enable/Disable a simple UI
    -> tui enable
    -> tui disable 
- Print a value
    Regularly -> p $<variable/register>
    In Binary -> p/t $<variable/register>
    In Hex    -> p/x $<variable/register>
